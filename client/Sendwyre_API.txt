Hi!

We are looking to build a crypto exchange site using the 
Sendwyre White label API: https://docs.sendwyre.com/reference/white-label-card-processing

It would be a relatively simple single-page app. 
The user will fill in relevant info: Currency, amount, crypto adress etc. 
The app will then use the Sendwyre API to handle payments and transactions.

Initially we have no need for User/Login functionality, but we might want to expand the app with more features down the line. 
As far as the deadline we want it done as soon as possible, however, we would rather have a stable app with a bit longer dev time than a rushed buggy one.

Please take a look at the Sendwyre Docs and let us know a timeframe
